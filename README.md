# Weather app with React + TypeScript + Vite
This marks my very first self-developed website. I experimented with React.js and the openWeather API to bring it to life. [UPDATE: December 2024] After some months of frontend development experience, I refactored the whole project, to use React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind :)
